This is a simple (for now) project that enables Luxonis' DepthAI camera to work with ROS2 based systems. For now, it consists of a base mobilenet_camera example, which outputs detections based on a pretrained SSD model. The code is loosely based on depthai examples, but it follows more object-oriented pattern. Code was being tested on: - OAK-D lite camera on a x86 PC - ROS2 Galactic - OAK-D camera on a x86 PC - ROS2 Galactic - OAK-D camera on an ARM based system - Nvidia Jetson, using ROS2 Galactic built from source Installation To build the package you should download and install the latest depthai_core library and its dependencies. sudo wget -qO- http://docs.luxonis.com/_static/install_dependencies.sh | bash git clone --recursive https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-core.git cmake -Hdepthai-core -Bdepthai-core/build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local sudo cmake --build depthai-core/build --target install Running To run only the mobilenet_camera, run ros2 run depthai_ros_driver mobilenet_camera To launch it together with rviz and a node that outputs the detections as TF frames and markers, ros2 launch depthai_ros_driver mobilenet_camera.launch.py use_rviz:=True Known issues mobilenet camera experiences lower frame rate than what is set.
